In the spirit of creating consistency, we analyzed all of our user interfaces, looked for patterns and common components, and, at the end developed a massive design system called <b>Redwood.</b> But this process, as most projects in large companies, was not straight forward and it took massive cross-team collaboration and support from Oracle's leadership team, including <b>Larry Ellison</b> himself.</p>"
